Data and Machine Learning Tasks

This repository contains four tasks that demonstrate the use of Python for data processing, web development, and machine learning. Each task is implemented in a separate script and showcases a specific use case.

Task 1: Build a Simple Web Application with Flask
Description: This task involves creating a basic web application using the Flask framework. It includes:

A homepage that displays a simple message.
A personalized greeting route where users can input their name.
How to Run:

Install Flask using pip install flask.
Run the script: python flask_app.py.
Access the app in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Task 2: Fetch Weather Data Using wttr.in API
Description: This task demonstrates how to fetch and display weather data for a given city using the public wttr.in API.

How to Run:

Ensure you have the requests library installed: pip install requests.
Run the script: python fetch_weather.py.
Enter a city name when prompted to see the weather details.
Task 3: Analyze Data from a CSV File
Description: This task involves analyzing a dataset using the Pandas library. The script includes:

Loading a dataset from a CSV file.
Calculating basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
Filtering rows based on specific conditions (e.g., Salary > 60,000).
Grouping data by a categorical column (e.g., Department) and calculating averages.
How to Run:

Make sure you have the pandas library installed: pip install pandas.
Place your dataset in the specified location or update the file path in the script.
Run the script: python analyze_data.py.
Task 4: Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris Dataset
Description: This task showcases a basic machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training a Decision Tree Classifier.
Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy.
Visualizing the decision tree.
How to Run:

Install required libraries: pip install matplotlib scikit-learn.
Run the script: python decision_tree.py.
View the decision tree visualization and accuracy in the output.
